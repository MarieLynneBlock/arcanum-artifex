# Mindmap

> **Back to [Style Guide](../mermaid-style-guide.md)** — Read the style guide first for emoji, colour, and accessibility rules.

**Syntax keyword:** `mindmap`
**Best for:** Brainstorming, concept organisation, knowledge hierarchies, topic breakdown
**When NOT to use:** Sequential processes (use [Flowchart](flowchart.md)), timelines (use [Timeline](timeline.md))

> ⚠️ **Accessibility:** Mindmaps do **not** support `accTitle`/`accDescr`. Always place a descriptive _italic_ Markdown paragraph directly above the code block.

## Tips

- Keep to **3–4 main branches** with **3–5 sub-items** each
- Use emoji on branch headers for visual distinction
- Don't nest deeper than 3 levels
- Root node uses `(( ))` for circle shape
- **Always** pair with a Markdown text description above for screen readers
